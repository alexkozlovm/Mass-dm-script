## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikhailkozlov/Mass-dm-script.git
   cd Mass-dm-script
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Grant accessibility permissions:**
   - Go to **System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Accessibility**
   - Add and enable Terminal (or your Python IDE)
   - This allows the script to control your mouse and keyboard

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Simple message:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "Hello {name}! Welcome to our community!"
```

**Multiline message with markdown (using \n for newlines):**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "# Hello {name}!\n\n**Welcome** to our server!\n\nJoin us at: discord.gg/example"
```

**Load message from a file:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json --message-file message.txt
```

This is the recommended approach for longer, formatted messages. Simply create a text file with your message (see `message_example.txt` for an example).

### Command Line Options

```bash
python dm_sender.py <users_file> [message] [options]

Required:
  users_file          JSON file containing user data

Message (one of):
  message             Message to send (supports placeholders). Use \n for newlines.
  --message-file FILE Read message from a text file

Optional:
  --delay SECONDS    Delay between messages (default: 5, minimum: 5)
  --start INDEX      Start from this user index (default: 0)
  --max COUNT        Maximum messages to send (default: all)
```

### Examples

**Send to all users with 5-second delay:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "Hey {name}! üëã"
```

**Send with 10-second delay between messages:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "Hello {display_name}!" --delay 10
```

**Send multiline message with formatting:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "# Hi {name}!\n\n**Welcome** to our community! üéâ" --delay 10
```

**Send message from a file (recommended for long messages):**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json --message-file message.txt --delay 10
```

**Resume from user index 50:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "Hi there!" --start 50
```

**Send to only 10 users (testing):**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "Test message" --max 10
```

## JSON User Data Format

Your JSON file should contain an array of user objects with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1026118653122461717,
    "name": "username",
    "display_name": "Display Name",
    "joined_at": "2025-09-17T20:19:08.383000+00:00"
  }
]
```

**Required fields:**
- `name` - Discord username (used for searching)

**Optional fields:**
- `id` - User ID
- `display_name` - Display name
- `joined_at` - Join date

See `users_example.json` for a complete example.

## Message Placeholders

You can use the following placeholders in your messages:

- `{name}` - User's username
- `{display_name}` - User's display name
- `{id}` - User's Discord ID

**Example:**
```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "Hey {name}! Your ID is {id}"
```

## Formatting Long Messages

### Using Message Files (Recommended)

For longer messages with formatting, create a text file with your message:

1. Create a text file (e.g., `message.txt`)
2. Write your message with formatting (markdown, emojis, newlines)
3. Use placeholders like `{name}` where needed
4. Run the script with `--message-file`:

```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json --message-file message.txt --delay 10
```

**Example message file (`message_example.txt`):**
```

### Using Command Line with \n

You can also use `\n` for newlines in command-line messages:

```bash
python dm_sender.py users.json "# Hello {name}!\n\n**Welcome!** üéâ\n\nJoin us!" --delay 10
```

**Note:** The `--message-file` option is recommended for longer messages as it's easier to write and edit.

## How It Works

1. **GUI Automation:** The script uses PyAutoGUI to control your mouse and keyboard
2. **Discord Search:** Opens Discord's quick switcher (Cmd+K) to search for users
3. **Message Sending:** Types the message and presses Enter
4. **Rate Limiting:** Waits between messages to avoid triggering Discord's spam detection

## Setup Before Running

1. **Open Discord Desktop App:**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - The app should be visible (not minimized)

2. **Position Discord Window:**
   - Place the Discord window where it's clearly visible
   - Don't overlap with other windows during execution

3. **Prepare Your User Data:**
   - Create a JSON file with your user list
   - Verify the data is correctly formatted

4. **Test First:**
   - Run with `--max 2` to test with just 2 users
   - Verify messages are being sent correctly

## Emergency Stop

If something goes wrong, you can stop the script immediately by:

- Moving your mouse to the **top-left corner** of the screen (PyAutoGUI failsafe)
- Pressing **Ctrl+C** in the terminal

## Logging

The script creates a log file `dm_sender.log` with detailed information about:
- Users processed
- Messages sent/failed
- Any errors encountered

Check this file if you need to troubleshoot issues.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small:** Test with 2-3 users before sending to hundreds
2. **Use Delays:** Keep delays at 5+ seconds (10+ is safer)
3. **Monitor Activity:** Watch the first few messages to ensure everything works
4. **Respect Users:** Only message users who expect to hear from you
5. **Check Logs:** Review `dm_sender.log` after each run
6. **Stay Compliant:** Be aware of and respect Discord's Terms of Service

## Troubleshooting

**Script not working:**
- Ensure Discord desktop app is open and logged in
- Check that you granted Accessibility permissions
- Verify Discord window is visible (not minimized)
- Make sure your JSON file is properly formatted

**Messages not sending:**
- Increase the delay with `--delay 10`
- Check if usernames in JSON are correct
- Discord search might not find the user if username is wrong

**Getting rate limited:**
- Increase delay between messages (--delay 15 or higher)
- Send fewer messages per session
- Wait a few hours before sending more

**Script stops unexpectedly:**
- Check `dm_sender.log` for error messages
- Ensure Discord window stays focused
- Don't interact with your computer while script is running

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains:
- Default settings
- Message templates
- Safety warnings

You can modify this file to customize default behavior.

## Limitations

- **macOS Only:** This version is designed for macOS (uses Cmd+K shortcut)
- **GUI Required:** Must have Discord desktop app open and visible
- **Manual Setup:** Requires accessibility permissions
- **Rate Limits:** Discord may still rate limit your account
- **Username Required:** Can only search by username (name field)

## Alternative Approaches

If this script doesn't meet your needs, consider:

1. **Discord Bot API:** Create a proper bot (but bots can't DM users without mutual servers)
2. **User Account Bots:** Against Discord ToS and risky
3. **Manual Messaging:** The safest approach
4. **Discord's Official Features:** Use announcement channels or role mentions
